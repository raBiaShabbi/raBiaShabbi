- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that the term "bug" to describe a software defect originated in 1947?
-              Back then, at Harvard University, technicians found a moth stuck in a relay of the Mark II computer.
-              They taped the moth into their logbook with the entry: "First actual case of bug being found."
-              Since then, the term "bug" has been widely used in the software industry to refer to any flaw or error in a computer program.
