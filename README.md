- ⚡ Fun Fact: Did you know that the term "bug" to describe a software defect originated in 1947? 
              Back then, at Harvard University, technicians found a moth stuck in a relay of the Mark II computer. 
              They taped the moth into their logbook with the entry: "First actual case of bug being found." 
              Since then, the term "bug" has been widely used in the software industry to refer to any flaw or error in a computer program.
